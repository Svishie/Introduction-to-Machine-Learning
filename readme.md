# Introduction to Machine Learning

Introduction to Machine Learning using CNNs to classify images with Keras.

A course presented for Sopra Steria Norway
  
## Getting started

Clone the repo to your machine.
It is recommended to start by implementing a classifier for the MNIST-dataset. A template can be found in the mnist-folder.
The folder also contains an example of a solution, but it is recommended to give it a proper try before looking at the solution.

After you have implemented a classifier for the MNIST-dataset you can implement a classifier for the Fasion MNIST-dataset.
The template can be found in the fashion_mnist-folder.
